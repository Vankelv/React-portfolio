# React-portfolio
My name is Kelvin Samuel Klutse or Van Kelvin and I am a frontend web developer, brand identity designer, and IT support specialist. This portfolio is a showcase of my skills and projects that I have worked on.

In this repository, you will find the code for my portfolio website, which is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website features a clean and modern design, and is fully responsive, making it accessible on all devices.

You can navigate through the website to learn more about me, my experience, skills, and projects. You can also find links to my social media profiles and contact information, if you would like to get in touch with me.

Feel free to take a look at the code and use it as a reference for your own projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for visiting my portfolio GitHub repository!
